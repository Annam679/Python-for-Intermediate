#Hot Potato is a game in which children form a circle and toss a hot potato. 
#The counting starts with the first kid. Every nth toss, the child holding the potato leaves the game. 
#When a kid leaves the game, it passes the potato to the next kid. It continues until there is only one kid left.
#Create a program that simulates the game of Hot Potato. |
#On the first line, you will receive kids' names, separated by a single space. 
#On the second line, you will receive the nth toss (integer) in which a child leaves the game.
#Print every kid who is removed from the circle in the format "Removed {kid}". 
#In the end, print the only kid left in the format "Last is {kid}".
#Example Input: Tracy Emily Daniel /n 2
#Example Output: Removed Emily /n Removed Tracy /n Last is Daniel
